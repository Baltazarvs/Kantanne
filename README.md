<h1 align="center">Kantan-ne「簡単(だ)ね」</h1>
<p align="center">
  「簡単ね」is a HTML/CSS/JS repository that has features dedicated for learning and mastering Japanese language.
  It has flashcards or learning and linking to Jisho, as same as its own conjugator system that conjugates verbs
  using JavaScript. It offers simple interface and usage.
</p>
<h6 align="center">
  簡単ね is in early state of development and supports only GODAN verb conjugation. Development will continue
  until Kantanne is fully functional. It is planned to have full functional conjugator that supports GODAN,
  ICHIDAN, Irregular verbs and I-adjectives, as same as DA/DESU. Also, it will have fully functional flashcards
  that will be customizable by user using TXT file and will allow rich customization. If you wonder how does
  input text supports hiragana natively in conjugator, Kantanne uses WanaKana as it is great and
  helpful tool for this matter because writing one again and again is bottleneck.
